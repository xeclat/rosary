One day the archangel Gabriel appeared to Mary, who was perplexed at his greeting. He told her not to be afraid, that she was filled with grace and that the Lord was with her. He announced that she would bear a Son named Jesus, a Son Who would be the Son of the Most High and would reign over an unending Kingdom from the throne of David. Mary asked how this could be since she was a virgin. The angel had a ready answer. The Holy Spirit would come upon Mary, and the \u201cpower of the Most High\u201d would overshadow her. Her child would be holy. Nothing was impossible for God, the angel concluded, for her relative Elizabeth had conceived a child in her old age. After hearing all this, Mary said, \u201cHere am I, the servant of the Lord; let it be with me according to your word.\u201d She gave herself fully to God and offered her entire life to the fulfillment of His plan.",

The angel told Joseph that this Child, Who was to be named Jesus, would save the people from their sins and fulfill an old prophecy. Joseph obeyed the angel and took Mary as his wife. The couple traveled to Bethlehem in obedience to a Roman decree that everyone was to be registered in their own towns. There Mary gave birth to Jesus in a stable and laid Him in a manger. There was no room for the little family at the local inn. Angels appeared to shepherds keeping watch in a nearby field and announced to them the birth of the Savior. The shepherds hurried to Bethlehem to see the Child. They rejoiced in His presence, praised God, and spread the word about this amazing event. Mary watched and listened closely and pondered all these things in her heart. Meanwhile, travelers were coming, magi from the East. They arrived in Jerusalem, asking where they might find the newborn King of the Jews. They had seen His star and had come to pay Him homage. King Herod and the rest of Jerusalem were frightened at the magi's words. Herod called the chief priests and scribes and demanded to know where the Messiah was to be born. Bethlehem of Judea, they told him. Herod called the magi to him and learned when the star had appeared. He told them to go and find the Child and then come back and tell him so that he might also pay Him homage. The magi found Jesus with his mother, Mary.

Mary, always obedient and humble, went up to Jerusalem forty days after the birth of her Son to perform the ritual. Mary and Joseph also made the trip to present their firstborn Son to God, for all firstborn males were designated as holy to the Lord and had to be \u201credeemed\u201d or \u201cransomed\u201d through a ritual sacrifice. When the Holy Family arrived at the Temple, they found a man named Simeon waiting for them. Simeon was a devout and righteousness man who was waiting and watching for the Messiah. God had promised him that he would not die until he had seen the Savior. Led by the Holy Spirit, Simeon arrived at the Temple as Mary and Joseph were bringing Jesus in. Simeon reached out for Jesus, took Him into his arms, and praised God by proclaiming a prophetic word about the infant Messiah. He also warned Mary that she would experience sorrow as the Mother of the Savior. A sword would piece her soul. As Simeon finished speaking, an old woman named Anna approached the group. Anna had always remained in the Temple, fasting and praying. Now she praised God and immediately began to spread the word about the coming of the Messiah to all who were open to her message.",

Mary was already pure, for Jesus was conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit, and Jesus was already completely and totally dedicated to the Father. Why, then, did they go up to Jerusalem to perform the rituals?",
                "Consider the irony of the immaculate Mary submitting to ritual purification.",
                "It is significant that Luke doesn't specifically tell us that Jesus was ritually ransomed back as other firstborn sons were. Jesus was totally the Father's Son and, as such, was totally dedicated to God. Meditate on this truth.",

He had a good idea Who Jesus was (they were kinsmen after all), and he knew that Jesus should be baptizing him instead of the other way around. Jesus assured John that His baptism was part of God's plan, and John consented. When Jesus was coming up out of the water, praying, the heavens opened above Him, the Holy Spirit descended in the form of a dove and landed on Jesus, and a voice boomed out, \u201cThis is My Son, the Beloved, with Whom I am well pleased\u201d (see Matthew's account). After the baptism, John provided his testimony to the event, declaring that Jesus was indeed the Lamb of God and the Son of God Who would take away the sins of the world and baptize with the Holy Spirit.",
            "reflections": [
                "Look up the passages about John the Baptist in Matthew 3:1-12; Mark 1:1-8; and Luke 1:5-24, 1:39-45, 1:57-80, and 3:1-",
                "Who was John the Baptist as a person? What was he like? Why and how was he preaching? What was his message? What was his role in the divine plan of salvation history? How did people react to him?",
                "John was baptizing at the Jordan River, which is mentioned about 175 in the Old Testament and about 15 times in the New Testament. The Jordan was the site of more than one miracle (the crossing of the Israelites in Joshua 3:15-17, the healing of Naaman in 2 Kings 5, and the floating axehead in 2 Kings 6:1-7). Why did John choose to baptize in the Jordan River?",
                "John's baptism was one of repentance. It was a precursor to Christian baptism. Why was such a preparation needed?",
                "Jesus came from Galilee specifically to be baptized by John. Why?",
                "John humbly tried to prevent Jesus from being baptized. The Baptist understood his own role, and he knew at least a little bit about Jesus' identity. Think about John's response to Jesus' request.",
                "Jesus said, \u201cLet it be so now; for it is proper for us in this way to fulfill all righteousness.\u201d Ponder this command over the next few points.",
                "\u201cLet it be\u201d or \u201csuffer it to be\u201d has connotations of permitting but also of letting go. John had to let go of his thinking and accept Jesus' way of doing things.",
                "\u201cLet it be so now....\u201d God was doing something new at that time, right then at that moment in the history of salvation. Jesus focused John's attention on the present moment, and His role just then was to share in the human condition. Baptism was a part of that sharing.",
                "\u201cIt is proper\u201d means that an act is fitting. It is the right thing to do. It suits the situation. Jesus was reassuring John that His baptism was the right way to respond to God's will.",
                "\u201cIn this way to fulfill all righteousness...\u201d The Navarre Bible commentary notes, \u201c'Righteousness (or 'justice') has a very deep meaning in the Bible; it refers to the plan which God, in His infinite goodness and wisdom, has marked out for man's salvation. Consequently, 'to fulfill all righteousness' should be understood as fulfilling God's will and designs. Thus we could translate 'fulfill all righteousness' as; 'fulfill everything laid down by God'. Jesus comes to receive John's baptism and hence recognizes it as a stage in salvation history \u2013 a stage foreseen by God as a final and immediate preparation for the messianic era....Jesus, Who has come to fulfill His Father's will, is careful to fulfill that saving plan in all its aspects.\u201d",
                "John agreed and baptized Jesus. He accepted a mystery. He couldn't see the whole situation clearly, but he let go of his ideas and followed the will of God. Meditate on John's trust and obedience.",
                "Reflect on Jesus' actual baptism. Picture yourself floating down into the peaceful waters with Jesus.",

                "The heavens were opened. Mark's word choice suggests that they were \u201ctorn apart.\u201d The same Greek word is used in Matthew 27:51, Mark 15:38, and Luke 23:45 to describe the tearing of the Temple curtain when Jesus died. Ponder the significance of this.",
                "The Holy Spirit descended like a dove and landed on Jesus. Why did the Spirit choose the form of a dove? Meditate on the symbolism of the dove.",
                "The voice from Heaven spoke: \u201cThis is my Son, the Beloved, with Whom I am well pleased\u201d (in Matthew). Mark and Luke portray the Father as speaking directly to Jesus \u201cYou are My Son, the Beloved; with You I am well pleased.\u201d Why the difference?",
                "The Greek word for \u201cbeloved,\u201d agapetos, suggests a relationship between the Father and the Son that is pure love, more love than we can wrap our minds around. Ponder this extreme love.",
                "What does the title \u201cBeloved Son\u201d tell us about Jesus?",
                "The Father was well-pleased with Jesus, for Jesus was following the Father's will in detail. The Greek verb for \u201cam well pleased\u201d eudokeo can also mean \u201cdelighted.\u201d Meditate on the truth that because of Jesus, we can be the beloved children of God with whom He is well pleased and even delighted.",
                "Ponder the Baptism as an epiphany, a revelation of God, and a portrait of the Trinity.",
                "Picture the baptism scene. Did others hear the voice from Heaven or see the dove? How did they react?",
                "St. John does not depict the baptism, but he relates John the Baptist's later testimony about Jesus. Reflect on that testimony over the next few points.",
                "John saw Jesus coming toward him and proclaimed to all who could hear that He was the Lamb of God Who would take away the sins of the world. Ponder this sacrificial language that looks ahead to the cross.",
                "John said that he was baptizing because of Jesus so that He might be revealed to Israel. How did John's baptism reveal Jesus to Israel?",
                "Meditate on John's humility as he proclaimed that Jesus ranked ahead of him because He was before him.",
                "This about John as our role model. His eyes were always on Jesus, and he moved out of the way so that Jesus could take control.",
                "John had received a prophecy from God. When he saw the Spirit descending from Heaven and remaining on Someone, he would know that this was the One Who would baptize with the Holy Spirit. Ponder this prophecy and its fulfillment. What does it mean to be baptized with the Holy Spirit?",
                "Reflect on John's God-guided testimony that Jesus is the Son of God.",
                "John interpreted the events he witnessed, bringing together history and mystery. Think deeply about his interpretation of Jesus' baptism.",
                "Meditate on how God broke into the world at the baptism of Jesus. Eternity broke into time, the divine into the mundane.",
                "Benedict XVI offers an interpretation of Jesus' baptism that focuses on Jesus' solidarity with men. At the baptism, Benedict says, Jesus took upon Himself all our burdens and brought them down into the Jordan. He accepted \u201cdeath for the sins of humanity\u201d in a foreshadowing the cross. Consider this interpretation of the baptism as both identification and anticipation.",

Subtle and penetrating in its own nature, made yet more so by Christ's blessing, it touches the hidden springs of life, the secret places of the soul, by virtue of its all-pervading dew. The course of blessing is even yet more penetrating than the flow of waters.

Not that Christ was taught what He knew before, but they who stood by heard it, for whose sake the voice came. Again, when one says, in whom I am well-pleased; another, in you it has pleased me, if you ask which of these was actually pronounced by that voice; take which you will, only remembering that those who have not related the same words as were spoken have related the same sense. That God is well-pleased with His Son is signified in the first; that the Father is by the Son pleased with men is conveyed in the second form, in you it has well-pleased me.

Jesus' mother found out somehow that the hosts had run out of wine, and she came to Jesus with a simple statement, \u201cThey have no wine.\u201d At first, Jesus seemed to deny His mother's implied request that He do something to help, but apparently their conversation extended more deeply than their words, for His mother instructed the servants, \u201cDo whatever He tells you.\u201d Jesus told the servants to fill six stone water jars with water. Then He commanded them to draw out some of the liquid and take it to the chief steward. The servants did so, and probably much to their relief, the chief steward discovered a wine of superior quality to that previously served at the wedding.

                "Think carefully about the miracle of water turned into wine. Jesus never touched the water. He didn't speak any words over it. He silently willed it to be wine, and it was. Meditate on Jesus' power and complete control of the world around Him.",

Are you humble enough to see miracles? Why or why not? 12. In which areas of your life do you need to ask Jesus to change water into wine?",

The first age of the world, before the giving of the Law, was enlightened by the example of the Patriarchs; the second, under the Law, by the writings of the Prophets; the third, under grace, by the preaching of the Evangelists, as if by the light of the third day; for our Lord had now appeared in the flesh. The name of the place too where the marriage was held, Cana of Galilee, which means, desire of migrating, has a typical signification, viz. that those are most worthy of Christ, who burn with devotional desires, and have known the passage from vice to virtue, from earthly to eternal things.",

His real nature, however, was beginning now to be revealed by John, and His own conversations with His disciples; besides that His conception, and the circumstances of His birth, had from the first given rise to high expectations in her mind: as Luke tells us, His mother kept all these sayings in her heart. Why then did she never ask Him to work a miracle before? Because the time had now come that He should be made known. Before He had lived so much like an ordinary person, that she had not had the confidence to ask Him.

Instead, it was, and is, an ongoing process that began with Jesus' announcement early in His public ministry that the kingdom of God was at hand. It extended through the call of the disciples and the conversion of people like Zacchaeus, the Samaritan woman, and the sinful woman who cried on Jesus' feet. It continued in Peter's preaching after the Resurrection and in Paul's conversion. Finally, it touches all of us today as we make our own conversion journeys into the kingdom of God.",

Think about how Jesus is introduced as a great light; the focus on repentance; how the kingdom has come near; Jesus Himself as the kingdom; the fullness of time; the fulfillment of Isaiah's prophecy as described in Luke; the characteristics of the kingdom as presented in Luke; the persecution of Jesus as described in Luke; the coming of the kingdom to the Gentiles; and how Jesus passed through the midst of the crowd and went away.",

Consider how the disciples were called to fish for people; how they immediately left their nets and their families and followed Jesus; the strength of the call; the disciples' total surrender; the miraculous catch in Luke; Peter's obedience, astonishment, and fear in response to the miraculous catch; God's lavishness; Jesus' control and power; the disciples' staying with Jesus as described in John; the disciples' realizing they had found the Messiah on the testimony of John the Baptist; Jesus' calling Simon \u201cPeter\u201d; Nathanael's doubt and confession; and Jesus' prediction that the disciples would see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man.",

Reflect on how Jesus converted Matthew with only two simple words, \u201cFollow Me\u201d; the nonverbal communication between Jesus and Matthew; what it meant that Matthew was a tax collector; Matthew's total surrender to Jesus; how Matthew left everything to become a disciple; Matthew's party and missionary efforts; Jesus' role as a physician; Jesus' desire for mercy, not sacrifice; Jesus' breaking all the rules by eating with the \u201cunclean\u201d; how the Pharisees directed their question at the disciples, not at Jesus; and the call to repentance.",

                "Consider the story of the sinful woman (see Luke 7:36-50). Here is a story of conversion.

                "Ponder the conversion story of Zacchaeus (see Luke 19:1-10). Reflect on how Zacchaeus was the chief tax collector, very rich, and therefore, probably a crook; how tax collectors were the lowest of the low among the Jews; and how Zacchaeus was so drawn to Jesus that he risked looking like a fool and climbed a tree to see Him. Think also about how Jesus invited Himself to stay at Zacchaeus' house and about Zacchaeus' response of repentance and satisfaction for his sins. Consider how Jesus' mission was fulfilled in Zacchaeus.",
                "Reflect on the story of the Samaritan woman (see John 4:1-42).

                "Ponder Paul's conversion (Acts 9:1-19). Think about how Paul's physical blindness manifested his former spiritual blindness; Jesus' identification with the Church (to persecute the Church was to persecute Jesus); fasting and prayer as part of conversion; Ananias' vision; how Ananias laid hands on Paul; how people assist one another along the path of conversion; Jesus' desire to use Paul as His instrument; how Paul became filled with the Spirit; how something like scales fell from Paul's eyes; and the Eucharistic overtones involved in Paul's taking food to regain his strength."

Moses and Elijah appeared next to Jesus and talked with Him about what was to happen shortly in Jerusalem. Peter, overcome with awe, asked Jesus if he could make three tents, one for Him, one for Moses, and one for Elijah. He hardly knew what he was saying. While he was still speaking, a bright cloud overshadowed the group, and a voice rang out, \u201cThis is My Son, the Beloved, with Him I am well pleased; listen to Him!\u201d (see Matthew's version). The disciples were so frightened that they dropped to the ground. Jesus came over and touched His terrified disciples, telling them, \u201cGet up and do not be afraid.\u201d When the disciples arose, they saw no one but Jesus.

Luke says about eight days. Why do you think the accounts differ? Some fathers and scholars point to different ways of reckoning time. Luke includes \u201cbookend\u201d days, and Matthew and Mark don't. Others focus on the symbolism of the numbers. The number six might symbolize the fullness of creation, for God created the world in six days. The number eight might symbolize the Resurrection, which occurred on the eighth day (or the day after the Sabbath) in Jewish reckoning and pointed to the new creation. In any case, reflect on God's perfect timing.",

Keep in mind that Luke may be focusing on the otherness of Jesus during the Transfiguration, for the word he uses strongly connotates a distinction. Matthew and Mark's word is used only four times in the Gospels, twice to describe Jesus and twice to describe transformations in His disciples. What is significant about this?",

Let none suppose that He lost His former form and lineaments, or laid aside His bodily reality, taking upon Him a spiritual or ethereal Body. How His transfiguration was accomplished, the Evangelist shows, saying, And his face did shine as the sun, and his raiment became white as snow. For that His face is said to shine, and His raiment described to become white, does not take away substance, but confer glory. In truth, the Lord was transformed into that glory in which He shall hereafter come in His Kingdom. The transformation enhanced the brightness, but did not destroy the countenance, although the body were spiritual; whence also His raiment was changed and became white to such a degree, as in the expression of another Evangelist, no fuller on earth can whiten them. But all this is the property of matter, and is the subject of the touch, not of spirit and ethereal, an illusion upon the sight only beheld in phantasm.",

The first is this; because the multitudes said He was Elias, or Jeremiah, or one of the Prophets, He here brings with Him the chief of the Prophets, that hence at least may be seen the difference between the servants and their Lord. Another reason is this, because the Jews were ever charging Jesus with being a transgressor of the Law and blasphemer, and usurping to Himself the glory of the Father, that He might prove Himself guiltless of both charges, He brings forward those who were eminent in both particulars; Moses, who gave the Law, and Elias, who was jealous for the glory of God. Another reason is, that they might learn that He has the power of life and death; by producing Moses, who was dead, and Elias, who had not yet experienced death. A further reason also the Evangelist discovers, that He might show the glory of His cross, and thus soothe Peter, and the other disciples, who were fearing His death; for they talked, as another Evangelist declares, of His decease which He should accomplish at Jerusalem. Wherefore He brings forward those who had exposed themselves to death for God's pleasure, and for the people that believed; for both had willingly stood before tyrants, Moses before Pharaoh, Elias before Ahab. Lastly, also, He brings them forward, that the disciples should emulate their privileges, and be meek as Moses, and zealous as Elias. - St. John Chrysostom \u201cIf the transfigured humanity of Christ and the society of but two saints seen for a moment, could confer delight to such a degree that Peter would, even by serving them, stay their departure, how great a happiness will it be to enjoy the vision of Diety amidst choirs of Angels for ever? it goes on, For he wist not what to say; although, however, Peter from the stupor of human frailty knew not what to say, still He gives a proof of the feelings which were within him; for the cause of his not knowing what to say, was his forgetting that the kingdom was promised to the Saints by the Lord not in any earthly region, but in heaven; he did not remember that he and his fellow-Apostles were still hemmed in by mortal flesh and could not bear the state of immortal life, to which his soul had already carried him away, because in our Father's house in heaven, a house made with hands is not needed.

Since then that was almost incredible which was about to happen, He sent first indeed Prophets to announce it, afterwards He Himself comes clothed in the flesh, so that you could not suppose Him to be a phantom.

John hath told us, what the others have not, how that from the cross whereon He hung, He called to His mother. He thought it a greater thing to show Him victorious over punishment, fulfilling the offices of piety to His mother, than giving the kingdom of heaven and eternal life to the thief. For if it was religious to give life to the thief, a much richer work of piety it is for a son to honor his mother with such affection. Behold, He says, your son; behold your mother. Christ made His Testament from the cross, and divided the offices of piety between the Mother and the disciples. Our Lord made not only a public, but also a domestic Testament. And this His Testament John sealed a witness worthy of such a Testator. A good testament it was, not of money, but of eternal life, which was not written with ink, but with tile spirit of the living God: My tongue is the pen of a ready writer. Mary, as became the mother of our Lord, stood before the cross, when the Apostles fled and With pitiful eyes beheld the wounds of her Son. For she looked not on the death of the Hostage, but on the salvation of the world; end perhaps knowing that her Son's death would bring this salvation, she who had been the habitation of the King, thought that by her death she might add to that universal gift.",

This man, first and only, he found having no sin, free from guilt, owing nothing to the laws of his jurisdiction. But leagued with Jewish madness, Death comes again to the assault, and desperately invades the Life-giver. And Jesus, when be had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost. Wherefore should we be offended that Christ came from the bosom of the Father to take upon Him our bondage, that He might confer on us His freedom; to take upon Him our death, that we might be set free by His death; by despising death He exalted us mortals into Gods, counted them of earth worthy of things in heaven? For seeing the Divine power shines forth so brilliant in the contemplation of its works, it is an argument of boundless love, that it suffers for its subjects, dies for its bondsmen. This then was the first cause of the Lord's Passion, that He would have it known how great God's love to man, Who desired rather to be loved than feared. The second was that He might abolish with yet more justice the sentence of death which He had with justice passed. For as the first man had by guilt incurred death through God's sentence, and handed down the same to his posterity, the second Man, who knew no sin, came from heaven that death might be condemned, which, when commissioned to seize the guilty, had presumed to touch the Author of sinlessness. And it is no wonder if for us He laid down what He had taken of us, His life, namely, when He has done other so great things for us, and bestowed so much on us.",

Eight days later, He appeared again to the disciples, this time relieving the doubt of the apostle Thomas, who had declined to believe until he placed his fingers into the wounds on Jesus' hands and his hand into the wound on His side. Jesus appeared to His disciples again as they were fishing in Galilee and provided them with a miraculous catch. After a breakfast on the shore, Jesus asked Peter three times, \u201cSimon, son of John, do you love Me?\u201d When Peter replied to the affirmative, Jesus commanded Him to care for His sheep.

But the spices which the women bring, signify the odor of virtue, and the sweetness of prayers by which we ought to approach the Altar. The rolling back of the stone alludes to the unclosing of the Sacraments which were concealed by the veil of the letter of the law which was written on stone, the covering of which being taken away, the dead body of the Lord is not found, but the living body is preached; for although we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now henceforth know we Him no more. But as when the Body of our Lord lay in the sepulcher, Angels are said to have stood by, so also at the time of consecration are they to be believed to stand by the mysteries of Christ.

And after eight days again His disciples were within, and Thomas with them: then came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace be to you....And first He rebukes him; Then says He to Thomas, Reach hither your finger, and behold My hands; and reach hither your hand, and thrust it into My side: secondly, He admonishes him; And be not faithless, but believing.

Peace both in name and reality is sweet, which also we have heard to be of God, as it is said, The peace of God; and that God is of it, as He is our peace. Peace is a blessing commended by all, but observed by few. What then is the cause? Perhaps the desire of dominion or riches, or the envy or hatred of our neighbor, or some one of those vices into which we see men fall who know not God. For peace is peculiarly of God, who binds all things together in one, to whom nothing so much belongs as the unity of nature, and a peaceful condition. It is borrowed indeed by angels and divine powers, which are peacefully disposed towards God and one another. It is diffused through the whole creation, whose glory is tranquility. But in us it abides in our souls indeed by the following and imparting of the virtues, in our bodies by the harmony of our members and organs, of which the one is called beauty, the other health.\" - St. Gregary of Nazianzus"

Hearing the commotion, they flocked to the house where the disciples were. The crowd was amazed for each person heard the disciples speaking in his own language about the great deeds of God. Peter stood up and preached a sermon, explaining to the crowd how Jesus, the Messiah, fulfilled the prophecies contained in Scripture and how He suffered, died, and rose again and was now pouring out the Holy Spirit. He invited the Jews to repent and be baptized that their sins may be forgiven and they may also receive the gift of the Spirit.

A village woman one day broke into praise for Jesus exclaiming: 'Blessed is the womb that bore you and the breasts that nourished you.' Jesus said in reply: 'Rather, blessed are they who hear the word of God and keep it.' It was a compliment to his Mother on her fiat, her 'be it done.' She lived it sincerely, unstintingly, fulfilling its every consequence, but never amid fanfare, rather in the hidden and silent sacrifice of each day. \u2026 To become Godlike, to be divinized, we must begin by being very human, accepting from God our condition as ordinary men and sanctifying its apparent worthlessness. Thus did Mary live. She who is full of grace, the object of God\u2019s pleasure, exalted above all the angels and the saints, lived an ordinary life. Mary is as much a creature as we are, with a heart like ours, made for joy and mirth as well as suffering and tears.

That is why she can acknowledge, with full humility, that 'he who is mighty has done great things' in her.",
